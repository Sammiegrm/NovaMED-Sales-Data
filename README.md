Data Analytics Project Highlight for NovaMed SalesData

I recently built an interactive Sales & Operations Performance Dashboard for NovaMed Pharmaceuticals, designed to uncover the trends driving revenue, top-selling products, and buyer behavior across global markets. The dashboard gives a high-level view of company performance, making it easy for executives to track growth and profitability in real time.

Global Sales at a Glance
 
Total Revenue: $71.31M
Total Units Sold: 269K
Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $12.85M

Countries like the United States, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Australia lead in sales volume. This geographic distribution highlights strong market penetration in developed regions and reveals opportunities for expansion into underperforming markets.

Demand is highest for: Lisinopril, Prednisone, Gabapentin, Diclofenac, Albuterol respectively. Understanding top performers helps optimize inventory planning and forecasting for high-demand therapeutic categories.

COGS is distributed across five compliance categories, with Category 2 and Category 4 accounting for the highest costs. This insight helps identify where operational or regulatory inefficiencies may be increasing product costs.

The majority of the revenue (~93%) comes from Sellers, while Users account for only ~7%. This suggests NovaMed’s primary customers are wholesalers, pharmacies, and distributors rather than individual end-users.

Recommendations
Based on the insights:
1.     Expand into emerging markets where NovaMed has low sales visibility.
2.     Monitor compliance categories with high COGS to reduce operational costs.
3.     Increase customer diversification to reduce overreliance on a few top clients.

Conclusion
With the right strategic adjustments, the company can unlock even more value by expanding markets, optimizing inventory, and aligning costs with market demand.
